# RISC-V
A simple RISC-V instruction set architecture simulator written in Java. The program supports reading in programs as binary files and it produces a small text file indicating the content of each of the registers in the register file. The simulator is not pipelined - it implements a simple single-cycle processor.

# Guide
The simulator runs a given program when it is run from the command line. The simulator can be set up using a set of constants stored in the top of the IsaSim.java file. These constants are
- ```FILEPATH``` (string) indicating the relative path to the binary file to execute (no default value is provided)
- ```INITIAL_PC``` (integer) indicating the initial value of the program counter (default is ```0```, as programs are read into memory starting from memory address 0)
- ```INITIAL_SP``` (integer) indicating the initial value of the stack pointer (default is ```2^31 - 1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE```)
- ```DEBUGGING``` (boolean) indicating whether debugging prints to the terminal are wanted or not (default is ```true```)

When a program has been executed, the program prints a .txt file in the directory in which the test program is stored. The file is named after the program executed followed by ```_reg```. The file contains both the post execution register content from the simulator as well as the expected/correct register content provided to the program in corresponding binary .res files.
